    <h3>Description of Ice Cream</h3>
    <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has
         been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
          spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries 
          or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to 
          stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water 
          and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice 
          crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured 
          cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, 
          semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C 
          or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>
